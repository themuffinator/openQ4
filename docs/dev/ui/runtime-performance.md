# Retained UI measurements and vector caching

8 September 2026. This checkpoint adds runtime CPU measurements and removes
redundant path compilation during fades and whole-pixel movement. It advances
the [replacement plan](../plans/idtech5-ui.md); full performance qualification,
composition, production artwork, editor and GUI migration gates remain open.

## Cache behavior

Vector elements retain compiled, premultiplied path geometry independently of
opacity. A fade updates the submitted vertex colors without repeating curve
subdivision, stroke union, coverage integration or gradient subdivision.
Opacity still uses the existing per-primitive contract; isolated group fades
require the planned composition renderer.

Whole output pixels of translation are applied when submitting cached geometry.
Only the fractional translation phase participates in path compilation. The
viewport/scissor region is transformed into that coordinate space and expanded
to a 256-pixel grid for the cache key. Small movements can reuse the region;
crossing a cache-region boundary recompiles it. The render manager always clips
to the exact current viewport/scissor, including after movement or resize.

Changes to fractional position, scale, rotation, shear, layout dimensions or
the cached coverage region rebuild paths. Source reload clears both geometry
and tint caches. Density/video changes use the existing regeneration path.
This is a bounded cache per element, not an accumulating history of positions.

The native retained test compares animated cached geometry against a newly
loaded document at the same final position and opacity. It also checks live
clipping during translation, zero path compilation for opacity-only changes,
no geometry upload during whole-pixel movement, fractional-phase invalidation
and zero retained geometry allocations after shutdown.

## Tessellation precision regression

The moving 200% fixture exposed a single-precision tessellation failure at a
thin chamfered rail. A boundary returned two nominally coincident points at
`791.79998779296875` and `791.7999267578125`, creating a tiny extra loop. Its
calculated coverage at pixel `(791,0)` was `1.000010482367812`. The invariant
check rejected the path; static captures had not exercised that phase.

The pinned libtess2 subproject now uses a small
[double-precision patch](../../../subprojects/packagefiles/libtess2/double-precision.patch).
The patch changes `TESSreal` and the corresponding subnormal assertions; the
archive pin, allocator bounds and upstream license/credits are retained.
The compiler checks the expected scalar size, preventing a stale unpatched
header from silently using an incompatible ABI. No system libtess2 is used.

The boundary integrator also evaluates clamped linear trapezoids directly,
avoiding subtraction of nearly equal antiderivatives. The coverage invariant
remains intact. The failing rail is now exercised over ten fractional phases
with independent clipped-triangle area checks, and the 60-frame 200% motion
benchmark completes without path errors.

Meson applies the patch through its documented
[wrap diff mechanism](https://mesonbuild.com/Wrap-dependency-system-manual.html#diff-files).
Existing checkouts with an already-extracted unpatched dependency must refresh
that generated subproject before rebuilding:

```powershell
& tools/build/meson_setup.ps1 subprojects update --reset libtess2
```

This refresh replaces the generated libtess2 source directory. Keep any local
dependency changes as reviewed patches before refreshing it. Clean checkouts
apply the patch automatically when the pinned archive is extracted.

## Measurement interfaces

`Runtime::Statistics()` returns the most recent frame's CPU update/render time,
path compilation and geometry preparation time, compilation/cache/upload counts,
host draw counts and submitted vertex/index totals. Resident compiled-geometry
counts/bytes follow resource lifetime, including hidden elements. Vector cache
bytes describe the elements visited during that frame. These are tracked CPU
buffers, not total process memory, RmlUi's entire allocation graph or GPU memory.

The developer command `ui_retainedProfile <1..3600 frames>` records a bounded
sequence of rendered frames. Its final log line is JSON prefixed by
`Retained UI profile: `. Engine CPU timing includes retained evaluation,
submission and the surrounding GUI flushes. GPU execution, presentation and
the rest of gameplay are outside this measurement. Profile data does not change
the presentation clock or inject any input.

The capture harness accepts `--profile-frames N`, waits for the requested frames
before taking its engine screenshot and requires completed profile records.
With video restart, it checks both the original and recreated preview. The
report retains profile records alongside launch arguments and binary/log hashes.

## Native benchmark

`openq4-retained-ui-benchmark` loads the real vector fixture and uses the real
canonical evaluator, RmlUi layout and retained renderer. It exercises stationary,
opacity-only, whole-pixel and fractional translation scenarios, reporting JSON
lines with CPU percentiles, compilation/upload counts and tracked buffer peaks.
It uses synthetic font metrics and an empty draw host; it excludes the game's
font backend, engine vertex conversion, actual graphics APIs and GPU execution.
It is a diagnostic executable, not a timing threshold in the normal test suite.

```powershell
& tools/build/meson_setup.ps1 compile -C builddir openq4-retained-ui-benchmark
& builddir/openq4-retained-ui-benchmark.exe tools/ui/fixtures/vector-smoke.q4ui 1.25 60
& builddir/openq4-retained-ui-benchmark.exe tools/ui/fixtures/vector-smoke.q4ui 2 60
```

The baseline was `d096cc9f` with measurement instrumentation, before cache
changes, using the same fixture and scenarios. Its preserved benchmark binary
SHA-256 is `957e5c207fa893ec9f8bc83afc312d4f58bf5a93cdf24e67236b4385ef41b27d`.
Both comparisons use the existing Windows **debug, optimization 0** build.
They demonstrate work avoided in this fixture; they are not shipping-build
frame-rate results or cross-platform performance claims.

The 60-frame baseline compiled 780 paths during both opacity and whole-pixel
movement. The new cache compiles zero in either scenario. Opacity still rebuilds
780 tint submissions; whole-pixel movement also eliminates those uploads.
Fractional motion continues to compile the changing coverage. Additional cached
geometry increases tracked resident CPU memory and is included in the reports.

The final native benchmark binary SHA-256 is
`d5edcaa4dc38662c4d1307578b1013e027cdea4b11b034357e17b0828b94e200`.
Reports are under `.tmp/ui/ui-profile-baseline-{125,200}.jsonl` and
`.tmp/ui/ui-profile-final-{125,200}.jsonl`. Median CPU times in milliseconds:

| Scenario | 125% before | 125% after | 200% before | 200% after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Stationary | 0.85 | 0.57 | 1.39 | 0.81 |
| Opacity | 15.96 | 1.13 | 20.34 | 1.52 |
| Whole-pixel movement | 14.96 | 0.62 | 16.14 | 0.88 |
| Fractional movement | 17.38 | 13.12 | 39.64 | 22.32 |

These are individual local runs and include measurement variability. The final
implementation also has more precise tessellation, which removes numerical
fragmentation as well as fixing the rejected rail. The stationary fixture's
tracked buffer peak rises from 407,696 to 807,224 bytes at 125%, and from
480,600 to 1,470,080 bytes at 200%. Cold first-frame evaluation remains about
24 ms and 36 ms respectively in this unoptimized benchmark. Fractional movement
and cold compilation therefore remain explicit optimization/qualification work.

All three native test targets pass after the precision patch. Client, dedicated
and both renderer modules were built/staged before the final gameplay profiles.

## Gameplay evidence

The final hidden, windowed runs used the registered engine screenshot command
after active SP/MP gameplay, with mouse/controller input disabled and no host
input injection. The unchanged vector fixture's frames, thin rails, gradients,
ring/hole, check stroke and localized labels were reviewed from render-target
TGA files. Each profile contains 180 actual rendered frames, including entry
motion. SP repeats the profile after full video restart and timeline replay.

| Profile under `.tmp/ui/performance/` | CPU p50 / p95 / max (ms) | Path compilations | Outcome |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `sp-gl-125-restart`, original preview | 1.47 / 2.10 / 28.31 | 57 | SP `airdefense1`, OpenGL, 125%; exit 0, no warnings/errors/retained diagnostics |
| Same run, recreated preview | 1.48 / 12.37 / 13.80 | 130 | Second 180-frame profile and timeline replay confirmed |
| `mp-vulkan-200` | 2.23 / 7.72 / 45.48 | 109 | MP `q4dm1`, Vulkan, 200%, auto-join; exit 0, no errors/retained diagnostics |

The high maxima and motion percentiles remain visible here because cold and
fractional-motion work are not yet fully qualified. These unoptimized CPU
profiles include GUI flushes but do not measure GPU completion or frame pacing.

Both runs used client SHA-256
`c3ce0146e2c7b1466210728450ca454d5ed1dfa039e93cb7493ea53b72ff0df3`,

`120bd3c469282c0b23ce221f7f34f88556620633665bfa9a1de51f84180f8921`.

The MP log retains 93 existing content warnings; comparison with the preceding
MP capture found no new warning messages. The capture reports retain full
launch arguments, hashes, profile records and `replacement_acceptance: false`.
Windowed gameplay and these fixture screenshots do not qualify other platforms
or the complete 271-resource GUI corpus.

## Remaining requirements

Fractional motion and cold compilation still need optimized-build profiling,
and long documents need resource/performance stress tests. Geometry preparation
for opacity, retained clipping and engine vertex conversion can be improved
further. GPU timings, frame pacing at the supported refresh rates, the complete
density/aspect matrix, all GUI families and other platforms remain unqualified.
Composition/masks, complete paints/strokes/fonts, the visual editor and all
current GUI replacements remain separate required work.
